Mixed Google/R workflows

<https://github.com/ropensci/unconf16/issues/9>

Existing pieces of the (Google) ecosystem

  * [`googlesheets`](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets), [`driver`](https://github.com/noamross/driver)
  * [`gauth`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gauth)
  * [`rchie`](https://github.com/ropensci/rchie)

Goals

  * Facilitate mixed workflows / teams
    - Noam works in R Markdown, pushed one big button, and it makes a Google Doc for his collaborator
  * Can we round trip this?
    -
